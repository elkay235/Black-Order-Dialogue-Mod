# Contributing to the mod
I thank you for wanting to help us develop this mod. The following is a list of ways you can help contribute and leave your own mark on the mod to help it grow and become better.

## Reporting Bugs
If you have a bug please make an Issue report and follow the template provided. Reporting bugs helps us become more aware of issues in our code - or perhaps issues on the game's end itself. 

## Improvements
If you have an improvement you want to see implemented, please make an Issue report and follow the template provided for improvements. Improvements make the mod more smooth and enjoyable for everyone in the end.

## Ideas/Additions/Etc
If any of these three categories fit what you want, go ahead and look at the Discussions page, and make a topic in the Ideas category. Community input matters and helps give us ideas too for what we want to make outside of what is suggested.

### Direct Code Contributions
If you have or want to write code for something for the mod, or perhaps want to create art/texture files to be used, we ask that you follow the procedure above and make a topic in the Ideas category of the Discussions thread. Additionally, if an idea is implemented or you see that there is a card in the Projects tab that has not been worked on for a while, or hasn't even started, you can feel free to make a branch and make a pull request.

### Pull Request Guidelines
Your pull request should consist of a detailed description of the changes/additions/removals that were done, and why they were done if necessary. 

## Other
If you have other ways you want to contribute directly, make a topic in the Discussions tab. The general category will fit fine for now.
